This FAQ is based on the original work by @**farish278**. Many thanks to them!

This FAQ assumes you're using **xManager (Spotify)** v3.2+ and v8.6+ mod.

What is xManager and what does this mod do?
--------------------
**xManager** is an Android-only app which provides a centralized location to download the **xManager (Spotify)** mods from the **xManager Team**.

The **xManager (Spotify)** mod for Android disables most ads as well as removes restrictions in some regions like the 6-song skip limit and forced shuffle when using a non-premium Spotify account. The mod may also enable limited "**A/B Test**" features not normally enabled for most users.

Other than the **AMOLED** black theme, customized/unofficial Spotify modifications currently fall outside the scope of this project, please don't ask us to add such things.

**xManager (Spotify)** mod by **xC3FFF0E**, **Sherlock Holmes** and **Mr.Dude**

**Note:** There are currently no plans for xManager to support Spotify Lite/Spotify for Android TV.

Why are the mod features not working (forced shuffle/limited skips/song previews only, etc)?
--------------------
**If mod features are not working:**

Reopening the app will do the work else force close the app once (x1). If force closing oncs (x1) still doesn't work, try force closing twice (x2). This works 99% of the time.

**If force closing twice (x2) fails:**  
**A.** Clear app cache and data  
**B.** Clean install app (wipe app data or uninstall/reinstall mod)  
**C.** Reboot device  

If none of the above works then there may be an incompatibility between the version Spotify, your account and your phone. Try using a different **xManager (Spotify)** mod version.

Can I download songs with this mod?
--------------------
No. Music downloads will not work without a premium Spotify subscription.

However, Podcasts **CAN** be downloaded without the need of a Premium Subscription.

Is 'Very High' quality unlocked? Why do other/older mods allow 'Very High'?
--------------------
No. '**Very High**' quality requires a premium Spotify subscription. '**High**' quality is the highest option for non-premium users.

Other/older mods unlocked the toggle to select '**Very High**' without a 'Premium nag' but did not actually enable '**Very High**' quality. It was a visual change only.

More recent mod versions reflect this properly and will set '**Automatic**' quality if attempting to set '**Very High**' without a Premium Subscription.

If you **DO** have a premium subscription and are using the mod, it will give you the '**Very High**' quality if selected.

Why do I get ads when listening to podcasts?
--------------------
All users, even paying premium subscribers, get podcast ads. Spotify considers podcasts to be different than music and does not include them in their "**Ad-Free**" listening experience.

We may eventually implement a feature to block podcast ads but at the moment the mod for free users is on par with the paid/premium experience when it comes to podcast ads.

Why do I get ads when casting or using Spotify Connect?
--------------------
When casting or using Spotify Connect the audio is no longer sourced from the Spotify mod but instead handled directly by the Spotify API.

Free accounts will get ads. You can avoid ads on external devices by connecting your Android device to them via line-out cable or Bluetooth.

Why aren't lyrics working?
--------------------
On Nov 18, 2021 Spotify announced global support for real-time lyrics: [https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-18/you-can-now-find-the-lyrics-to-your-favorite-songs-in-spotify-heres-how/](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-18/you-can-now-find-the-lyrics-to-your-favorite-songs-in-spotify-heres-how/).

Why isn't Canvas working?
--------------------
Canvas is only supported in select regions. Try switching your region using the VPN method mentioned above.

If you are positive you are using a Canvas-supported region, make sure the Canvas option is toggled on in the app settings. If that still fails, try force stopping the app twice (x2).

Why isn't Group Sessions working?
--------------------
Spotify has disabled Group Sessions for FREE accounts. Only Premium Spotify accounts can make use of Group Sessions at this time.

Initially, Spotify had no "**protection**" on Group Sessions and the mod could allow creating or joining them with a free account. Spotify limited it so that free users could only create Group Sessions but disallowing them to join others.

Now the feature is entirely restricted and exclusive for Premium users.

Why isn't Spotify Mod working with Android Auto?
--------------------
Spotify mod works with Android Auto. If Spotify is not showing up in Android Auto:  
• Enable "Unknown Sources" in the Android Auto developer settings: [https://support.google.com/androidauto/thread/9008705/psa-how-to-enable-developer-mode-in-the-updated-android-auto-app](https://support.google.com/androidauto/thread/9008705/psa-how-to-enable-developer-mode-in-the-updated-android-auto-app).  
• Open the Spotify app on your phone before connecting to Android Auto.

Why is Spotify saying "no internet" / "14 days"!
--------------------
See here for Spotify region settings: [https://support.spotify.com/article/country-region-settings/](https://support.spotify.com/article/country-region-settings/)

Spotify free accounts can only be outside of their "**home region**" for up to 14 days at a time. If you get the 14-days message, use a VPN to change regions then sign into Spotify and change your location here: [https://www.spotify.com/account/profile/](https://www.spotify.com/account/profile/)

The "**No Internet/Offline**" error may happen in unsupported Spotify regions (use VPN to change region in Spotify settings on the website). It may also also happen in regions that do NOT have a "**free version**" of Spotify, such as South Korea which is Premium-Only and therefore cannot use the mod app unless using it with a Premium Subscription (or changing location with VPN).

The "**No Internet/Offline**" error is also a known Spotify bug which can happen randomly for seemingly no reason. It may or may not be related to your network connection, VPN, Spotify bug when combined with your phone/Android version/ROM/Spotify account etc.

All "**No Internet**", "**Offline**" and "**14-Days**" issues are unrelated to the mod and there's nothing that we can do on our end to fix it.

Why am I unable to log into the Spotify mod?
--------------------
It is recommended to sign into the Spotify mod using a Spotify account (email/userID + password) and NOT through the Google or Facebook login methods.

If you are unable to log into the Spotify mod, confirm the exact same email/userID + password is working with [Spotify](http://spotify.com/)’s website (do NOT use a password manager or saved password when logging into [Spotify](http://spotify.com/)’s website so you can confirm the password you are typing is exactly the same as what you are typing into the mod).

Sometimes Spotify resets passwords automatically for "**security**" reasons so your password which used to be correct is now disabled and you may need to follow the password reset steps that were sent to you via email.

It is recommended to always use an email address which you have access to. Using "**temp**" email is risky and if Spotify ever auto-resets your password or you forget your password, you may lose access to the account.

If you do not yet have a standard Spotify account, create one on [Spotify](http://spotify.com/)’s website rather than trying to create an account using the Spotify mod.

Why is Spotify "blank" after logging in, only showing a "Premium" button?
--------------------
This error may happen in unsupported Spotify regions (use VPN to change region in Spotify settings on the website).

It may also also happen in regions that do NOT have a "**free version**" of Spotify, such as South Korea which is Premium-only and therefore cannot use the mod app unless using it with a Premium subscription (or changing location with VPN).

Why isn't Google sign-in working with Spotify mod?
--------------------
Google sign-in is disabled in the mod. It is recommended that you use a standard [Spotify](http://spotify.com/)’s  login. Facebook sign-in does work but a Spotify login is still recommended instead.

If you do not yet have a standard Spotify account, you can use your existing Google account and create a Spotify password using the directions in this link.

Why aren't "Blend" invite links working with the mod?
--------------------
Currently opening Blend invite links in the Spotify mod does not work as intended.

In order the the invite page to open in the app after clicking a link, close Spotify and then reopen the app and you should be greeted with the Blend invite page.

Why isn't "X" working? Why does Spotify mod have "Y" bug?
--------------------
If Spotify isn't working properly always try the steps mentioned above to fix it first. Use the search function in the support group to see if others have had this issue.

Majority of the time if the mod isn't working, force stopping once (x1) or twice (x2) and mod features will start working again. If Spotify itself isn't working correctly it's most likely a bug with Spotify itself, your device and/or your account.

**Read the FAQ completely along with the group notes and pinned messages before posting anything.**

Very rarely does the mod ADD bugs. Sometimes the mod may actually FIX some Spotify bugs. If you are dealing with a Spotify bug, try using a newer/older mod version or hope that Spotify fixes the bug in a future update.

Why isn't "Z" feature available?
--------------------
Some Spotify features are regional like canvas, 'Hey Spotify' and etc. If you are not in a region which supports these features then they will not be available.

Alternatively, you can change your region to one of the supported regions to gain the feature you are looking for with a VPN then sign into the Spotify website and change your location in settings here: [https://www.spotify.com/account/profile/](https://www.spotify.com/account/profile/)

If you are in a supported Spotify region you will only need to be connected to the VPN when signing into the Spotify website to change your region.

If you are not in a supported Spotify region then you may need to remain connected to a VPN at all times.

What version do I download? Arm64-v8a or Armeabi-v7a? Normal or AMOLED?
--------------------
The architecture of your phone can be viewed through the xManager app.

• **Armeabi-v7a** builds work on both **Armeabi-v7a** and **Arm64-v8a** devices.

• **Arm64-v8a** builds ONLY work on **Arm64-v8a** devices.

Generally, you should use the builds that match your devices architecture but in some cases the **Armeabi-v7a** version may work better for you despite using **Arm64-v8a** hardware.

"**Regular**" or "**AMOLED**" is up to you and the only difference is the theme of the app. **AMOLED** = all black theme.

What is the "cloned" version of the mod?
--------------------
Some users may have a phone with Spotify pre-installed and they are unable to disable or uninstall the pre-installed version which blocks them from installing the standard mod.

The cloned version has a new/different Android package name and allows these users to install the mod.

Android's security does not allow updating an app/apk that shares the same package name to have a different file signature. The Spotify mod versions and the Official Spotify versions have different signatures but both use the same package name (**com.spotify.music**), this is why uninstalling the Official Spotify version first is required when using the mod. This also explains why those with pre-installed Spotify versions are unable to use the mod and why we offer a "**cloned**" version of the mod for those users.

The "**cloned**" version should be considered a bonus and not something you should expect to be updated any time an update for the standard mod is released. There may or may not be an **AMOLED** version of the "**cloned**" released.

There most likely will ONLY be an **Armeabi-v7a** "**Cloned**" version. Both **Armeabi-v7a** and **Arm64-v8a** devices can use the Armeabi-v7a build, do not ask for an **Arm64-v8a** version if one is not already provided.

What if I can't uninstall the stock Spotify app that was pre-installed on my device?
--------------------
See answer above.

Why are the xManager downloads failing or stuck at 0%?
--------------------
There are a variety of variables to consider but a majority of the download issues are due to too many users at once (**this happens right after a new release**) or the download host is down (**"file/link unavailable**").

You have the option to download directly from the support group instead.
When downloads hang at 0%, this is often an issue between our file hosts and the VPN or ISP you are using. Changing networks or VPN may fix the issue.
In some cases force closing xManager may help.

What does installation error, "App not installed" mean?
--------------------
**These errors are uninformative but most often happen for the following reasons:**  

• Insufficient space  
• Blocked by android security  
• One of the reasons in the "Parsing Error" section below  

For insufficient space errors, free up some space on your device then try again.

For installs blocked by security, depending on your Android version you may have to enable apps to be installed by "**Unknown Sources**" or enable a specific app (such as xManager) to install apps from unknown sources. See Google for more info.

What does installation error, "There was a problem parsing the package" mean?
--------------------
**Parsing errors are somewhat generic and can be caused by multiple things including (but not limited to):**  

• Incomplete download  
• Corrupted download  
• APK signature mismatch  
• Incompatible hardware  

For incomplete or corrupted APK issues you can try re-downloading the app.

APK signature mismatch can be fixed by uninstalling the current Spotify app first.

Incompatible hardware issue is caused by trying to use **Arm64-v8a** **(ARM64)** builds on an **Armeabi-v7a** **(ARM32)** device. **ARM64** devices can use **ARM32** or **ARM64** apps but **ARM32** devices cannot run **ARM64** apps.

Where can I download xManager?
--------------------
xManager is available on GitHub, the official Telegram Group and Mobilism forums. Downloading it from any source may not be safe.
